      <h2>My First Blog Post: Creating a blog</h2>
      <em>Sept 14 2025</em>
      <p>This is the first blog post for my blogging site. For my first entry, I thought I would discuss the process of creating this site, and areas in which it could be improved in the future.</p>
      <p>Currently the site structure is very simple. There are only two pages so far - this page and the home page. The home page contains the links to all of my blog entries (currently this is the only blog entry). Each blog entry contains a link back to the home page.</p>
      <p>I have chosen to host the site on github pages. I chose this option because of its ease of use and the fact that I have familiarity with it. Github pages only supports hosting static content, which is fine for the time being, although I may choose to reassess this in the future.</p>
      <p>Some areas that I am looking to improve the website are:
        <ul>
          <li>Putting all the blog post entries into a blog_posts directory.</li>
          <li>Creating/using a markdown templating engine to write my blogposts in markdown and have them converted to html</li>
          <li>Improving the styling of the website.</li>
        </ul>
